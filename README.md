# Banking System
A simple banking system built with Python that allows users to create accounts, log in, check balances, deposit, and withdraw money

## How it functions?
1. Initially asks the user if they would like to create a new account or not.
2. If not, the user is asked to login into their account.
3. Once succefully logged in, the user is given multiple options to choose from!

## Technologies used:
Python.

## How to run:
1. Download the Python files.
2. Run the main game script (`Banking-System.py`) in a Python environment.

## What I learned:
1. How to use, navigate, and manipulate data within a dictionary
2. How to use returned values from another function inside a different function.

## Future features and updates:
1. Be able to permanently save the input accounts inside a file for a more functional and convenient system.
2. Possibly add a user interface (GUI).
